### Power Law Scaling Analysis

**Fit Model**: γ = γ₀ · (ω/ω₀)^α

**Results**:
- Exponent: **α = -0.150**
- Fit quality: **R² = 0.877** (for power law fit itself)
- p-value: **7.27×10⁻⁶** (highly significant)
- Coefficient: γ₀ ≈ 0.00038 at ω₀ = 1

**Interpretation**:
Decay rate decreases weakly with energy scale.
Change from lowest to highest strength: 36% reduction (factor of 1.56×)

## THEORETICAL COMPARISON

### Quantum Zeno Effect Prediction
**Standard theory**: γ ∝ ω^(-2)

| Source | Exponent | Basis |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Theory (Zeno) | -2.0 | Coupling suppression at high frequencies |
| Your measurement | -0.150 | Empirical data |
| Discrepancy | 92.5% | Huge mismatch |

**Conclusion**: Data incompatible with Zeno effect prediction

### Fit Quality Analysis

**R² Values by Strength**:
- Weak strengths (s ≤ 2.0): R² < 0 (exponential model worse than mean)
- Medium strengths (s = 3-6): R² ≈ 0 to 0.16
- Strong strengths (s ≥ 8): R² ≈ 0.21 to 0.29

**Meaning**: 
- Simple exponential decay P(t) = exp(-γt) does NOT fit well
- Especially poor at low energies (negative R²)
- Suggests more complex dynamical behavior than exponential relaxation

---

## UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

1. **Why is the exponent so shallow?** (α = -0.15 instead of -2.0)
   - Not explained by Quantum Zeno effect
   - Not explained by standard motional narrowing
   - Possible causes: finite-size effects, non-Markovian dynamics, system-environment correlations

2. **Why are R² values negative at low strengths?**
   - Indicates decay is NOT exponential
   - Suggests time-dependent decay rate or multi-timescale process
   - Early times show especially poor exponential fit

3. **What causes the overall 36% suppression?**
   - Weak compared to initial 7× observed in baseline (which was ratio of early to late rates)
   - May be saturation to minimum purity
   - May be approach to equilibrium in finite system

4. **Does minimum purity level off at weak coupling?**
   - Not measured in TEST 1
   - Would indicate saturation mechanism
   - Requires long-time measurement (t > 10s)

5. **Are memory effects present?**
   - Suggested by poor exponential fit
   - Not directly measured in TEST 1
   - Would require system-environment entanglement analysis

## DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

### Strengths
- Large number of trajectories (50 per condition)
- Wide energy range (24× coverage: ω from 2.5 to 60)
- Rigorous statistical analysis
- Multiple independent measurements
- Clear power law relationship (R² = 0.877 for fit itself)

### Limitations
- Only one system size (N=6)
- Only one coupling strength (g=0.02)
- R² poor for individual trajectory fits (suggests model mismatch)
- Cannot distinguish between mechanisms without additional tests
- System may be in size/coupling regime where standard theory breaks down

---

## CONCLUSIONS FROM TEST 1

1. **Effect is real and reproducible**
   - Consistent across 600 measurements
   - Low noise/high signal

2. **Mechanism is NOT Quantum Zeno**
   - Exponent wrong (−0.15 vs −2.0)
   - Scaling incompatible with theory

3. **Decay is NOT simple exponential**
   - R² values negative at low strengths
   - Suggests more complex dynamics

4. **Suppression is moderate (36%), not dramatic (7×)**
   - 7× in baseline was measurement artifact (early vs late rates)
   - True energy-dependent suppression is weaker

## OPEN QUESTIONS FOR EXPERT FEEDBACK

To be addressed with quantum physicist consultation:

1. Is γ ∝ ω^(-0.15) expected for a 6-qubit system, or does it indicate anomalous behavior?

2. Given negative R² values at low strengths, what mechanisms could produce non-exponential decay?

3. Could finite Hilbert space saturation explain the observed scaling, or is something else likely?

4. What would be the most efficient way to determine the actual decay mechanism?

5. Is this system worth investigating further, or is the behavior expected and well-understood?
